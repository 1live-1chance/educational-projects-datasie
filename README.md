This is a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits.
The main library for directly implementing the model was tensorflow. The code is divided into two files and is written in the OOP paradigm.
The configuration.py file contains a class for implementing and training the model on the built-in dataset.
The main.py file is where the actual implementation of the model occurs and a class for visualizing model training data.

The code was posted to the repository for reference only.
